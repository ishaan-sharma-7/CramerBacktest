2024-08-13T13:54:47.000Z,"Welcome Jonathan Gray, President Blackstone!!"
2024-08-13T11:22:53.000Z,Nice comeback from the down 15 level for Home Depot as people trade the stock with no knowledge whatsoever
2024-08-13T10:55:08.000Z,"Yep, 15 points bad. Wow, at a certain point you buy it if only for the upcoming rate cuts"
2024-08-13T10:14:46.000Z,"Yeah, Home Depot looks bad,  but down ten points bad? Only if you think it will be down 15 when it opens"

2024-08-07T12:02:48.000Z,The weakness in DIS theme parks should not be driving things down. A perusal of the research shows most analysts were forecasting that . No one forecasting eps breakout for streaming
2024-08-07T11:15:50.000Z,Disney parks down mid single digits is driving things down. I think it was expected but people acting surprised.  Will color the stock but we  know consumer is soft. We will have lots on it when we write about it for the club

2024-08-07T10:02:00.000Z,I don't want anyone to think that any stock is going up this morning based on the fundamentals. It is the alleviating of the pressure from the Japanese central bank. We saw this nonsense many times back in the 90s. You could never tell who or where the sellers were coming from

2024-08-05T08:52:51.000Z,Nothing really happened to send the Nasdaq futures from down 2.47% to down 3.4% in five hours of a closed market. Things have gotten weaker in the economy but a 1/4 point cut would not have been a savior
2024-08-05T08:51:24.000Z,"I do not want to call it over-exaggerated, but it would be more thoughtful if the decline were based on more basics and less emotion."
