The real increase has occurred in the domestic natural gas market, totally unrelated to this war as oil has held steady"
2024-09-30T09:41:43.000Z,In 1973 the U.S. produced 9.2 million barrels of oil a day. Now it is over 13 million barrels. Meanwhile Russia is flooding the world with oil and OPEC is a shadow of its former self. That could be the linchpin that explains how you could still have a bull market in September of
2024-09-30T09:36:02.000Z,"Those of us old enough to recall the Yom Kippur War in 1973, remember the four-fold increase in oil from an OPEC embargo, admittedly off a very small base. This time there is no Egypt or Syrian invasion where Egypt had superior weaponry backed by the Soviet Union"

2024-07-19T19:11:30.000Z,We've been telling Investing Club members that the Street will go gaga on Monday for PANW...It is surprisingly not up much at all. They are chief rivals for heaven's sakes! You think Nikesh will do nothing? Think again...
2024-07-19T19:07:06.000Z,Rally started on time but not power to it yet...Kind of lumbering...
2024-07-19T15:54:34.000Z,"Memo to those who think that there could be a rally, no great rally in even a bear market can start until roughly 2:45 p.m. most of the time in the last 40 years. Worth remembering"
2024-07-19T14:08:12.000Z,Very big dichotomy developing between tech that has China exposure and non-China techs. Worth watching as there has been little separation of hyperscale with pure tech this whole time
2024-07-19T14:01:42.000Z,"Interesting how hard the hyperscaler stocks are trying to bottom but the sellers will not quit, the market has turned hard against them and six of the seven are being shorted and sold at every attempt to rally. Still gruesome"

2023-12-01T20:06:09.000Z,"The move is most pronounced in the high short-based names like Airbnb or coinbase or anything in the mall. Again, i need you to think about all of the billion dollar jamokes and big-time strategists who are in total denial about this rally."
2023-12-01T20:03:13.000Z,"So often in my career i have seen the ""brilliant"" strategists and billionaires simply miss out on these moves and just act like they are never happening. We do NOT do that in the CNBC Investing Club. Not at all.."
2023-12-01T20:01:21.000Z,This rally reminds me of some of the great 1980s and 1990s rallies where rates would go down and stocks would soar. I am not sure people realize how truly powerful this rally is. It is extraordinary...
2023-12-01T19:52:35.000Z,The shorts are scrambling all over the place. I am sure they are wondering whether to cover their Caterpillar short. My advice: cover
2023-12-01T19:51:44.000Z,I think this move in charitable trust name Footlocker is making the shorts mighty nervous... I think Mary Dillon is going to engineer the same turnaround she did for Ulta.

2023-12-01T00:58:18.000Z,ULTA was just flat out strong. So many analysts went negative on it recently that you can feel the shorts cringe right now.
2023-12-01T00:56:58.000Z,"If you only read the headlines for PVH you truly would think it was not so hot. But the call was FULL of real positives.. So much good happening on profitability, on margins, on inventory"

2023-11-30T09:48:54.000Z,When it comes to cyber security in the cloud Crowdstrike is winning for cloud native and Palo Alto is winning for soup to nuts with on prem. They are pulling away. People want more than Microsoft and these hacks are deadly
2023-11-30T09:47:39.000Z,"Because of the cost of computing, including AI, many companies are turning to Snowflake to ""rent"" the cloud and the SNOW analytics because it's less expensive and more discrete/discreet. Slootman is a take no prisoners kind of guy. They bought back a ton of stock."

2023-11-29T09:36:55.000Z,Intuit is incredibly solid and remains the engine of all small business because taxes are what can sink you. I like their ADP deal even as i think that ADP is often too big to help small biz itself.
2023-11-29T09:35:45.000Z,I liked Crowdstrike. Watch the Formula One video in the deck to get a good feel for what they do
2023-11-29T09:35:10.000Z,Six out of ten analysts offer a hearty congratulations to Workday on call. Could be good for 10 points or more
2023-11-28T21:24:27.000Z,People saying Crowdstrike not increasing forecast as much as the beat would figure. We own Palo Alto for the trust but respect that this looks like a great quarter for its competitor
2023-11-28T21:16:20.000Z,Intuit is a conference call stock (trades on internal commentary) but so far so good.

2023-11-16T09:56:51.000Z,Fourth read of the Palo Alto transcript. I think the confusion is not on my end... it is on the end of the way we look at billings versus total contract value. The real issue though is that when there is confusion people sell..
2023-11-15T23:39:28.000Z,"This one is tricky because rents aren't uniform and because we are about to be inundated with apartments that were started at the same time post covid. That's never happened. I think rents come down hard very soon. Dinners out, not so soon"

2023-11-01T10:24:28.000Z,Each one set up like bowling pins. The only thing that can stop the ease of shortselling is equilibrium of sellers to buyers  and we don't have that yet--chart and too high vs rest of the market causing problems for all of these stocks
2023-11-01T10:21:46.000Z,"The two worst charts in the book are Apple and Nvidia, I say own these don't trade these but it is so easy to make yourself right if you are a shortseller here. Easy as pie. That ease with which a stock can be knocked down reminds me of a 1990 set up against the regional banks."

2023-11-01T09:37:45.000Z,The technical set up for some tech stocks is so weak that you simply have to prepare for the worst and not even hope for the best ... until there is a change in direction. Worst holders in the world: Apple and Nvidia. Your co-shareholders can't be trusted....

2023-10-25T15:26:40.000Z,The stock market is a bit of a comedy sideshow compared to bonds. Witness how Boeing went from being up big to being actually DOWN because of rates. Then up because oil goes lower which could influence rates.

2023-10-04T15:23:10.000Z,"oil decline really getting serious, at last driving yields down"
2023-10-04T14:04:16.000Z,Rates going right back up...
2023-10-04T13:47:11.000Z,oIl is really breaking here. When it ran we were told interest rates were screaming higher. Not when oil comes down we get anemic bond reaction....hmmm
2023-10-04T12:34:42.000Z,Need more soft data to get squeeze going!
2023-10-04T12:17:25.000Z,"ADP--wages weaker, large company layoffs (small still good) short squeeze in bonds??????????????????"
2023-10-04T11:04:32.000Z,"JOLTS, according to Paychex, which knows, has frequently been wrong. There is also a possibility that professional organization are now trying to find people because people are available..."
2023-10-04T09:38:10.000Z,"Finally without layoffs and more fear from small businesses that are STILL expanding and STILL hiring, the fed has to stay tough and the 30 year must go to 5.75-6% not all at once but it is ineluctable... And stocks, which are viciously oversold like in March can snap back"
2023-10-04T09:36:16.000Z,bond shorts need Moody's downgrade to clean up here or could be burned by lack of Treasury selling and Fed selling and buyers from Europe go short their paper and buy our paper and clean up on yields soaring in Europe and the dollar getting stronger
2023-10-04T09:34:40.000Z,"The forced selling will continue in bonds until it is revealed who is too levered and blows up, probably when the 30 year yield exceeds the fed funds rate as it should on normal steepening"
2023-10-04T09:33:29.000Z,Couple more ideas: turns out it WASN'T oil that drove the bonds as it is headed down --especially with transports breaking down--and yet yields are going higher
2023-10-04T08:45:54.000Z,"But one final thought, let's not kid ourselves. Many banks are approaching their March lows, and the vultures are sensing that someone out there could be a Silicon Valley Bancorp...The group never really recovered...."
2023-10-04T08:44:36.000Z,"But here's the rub: once the fed and Treasury stop selling and issuing long-dated paper and we get to where panic doesn't drive us to those higher longer rates but logic does, we can have a calmer market and equities won't be as challenged."
2023-10-04T08:43:06.000Z,The idea that we could go from 3.75% on the 20 year to 5.13% from April until October is hard to comprehend. But i have said since that time that you can't own that piece of paper until it yields more than the fed funds rate because we are returning to a steep curve.
2023-10-04T08:40:31.000Z,There are others who are short long-dated treasuries and they are banking on looney-tune congresspeople to cause Moody's to downgrade our bonds and they will forever be regaled as geniuses on tv-FOR THAT ONE TRADE!
2023-10-04T08:39:17.000Z,"There is someone out there right now, at this moment, with billions of dollars in borrowed ten year and twenty year treasuries and they are praying that they will not be wiped out today. Not a position of strength"

2023-10-03T14:12:02.000Z,We have Paychex on tonight and it is clear that small business is still bullish and still hiring
2023-10-03T14:07:31.000Z,Too many jobs being created.. you need to see info like this NOT cause the bonds to get hammered and rates going higher .
2023-10-03T13:51:55.000Z,the heck with these weight loss drugs. i want to taste! Crave!!!!
2023-10-02T23:59:14.000Z,The bonds will not ignore a second day down in oil. There will be a short-cover rally if WTI touches $85
2023-10-02T14:52:11.000Z,If the bonds don't cool down they will crowd out any deal like this and it won't be worth bringing it right now!!!
2023-10-02T14:50:08.000Z,How many billions and billions of dollars were on the wrong side of the long end of the curve?? It is staggering how much has been lost.. And the short position has crushed it!!!
2023-10-02T14:04:20.000Z,The bond madness should slow when the twenty year yield crosses over the fed funds rate. I have been saying this since it hit 3.75% and i reiterate that it is my view wherever the fed funds rate goes to. (a 1/4 pt in November)
2023-10-02T13:50:24.000Z,I wonder what the morons who sold Micron down to $64 are thinking now. Maybe they should take their bat and their ball and go hit the ten year

2023-09-07T08:55:39.000Z,"It is punitive that the Chinese have decided to challenge the company in the world who employs the most people and has been a great partner in the ""by China for China"" policy. There was a real chance here for the Chinese, a real opening.. Just so wrong-headed"

2023-08-17T07:44:33.000Z,We are oversold but not enough to really get things moving and i have not historically loved this period..

2023-08-16T10:06:58.000Z,I am not dismissing what's happening in China. I am simply saying that the Chinese government is so communist yet it won't adopt Keynesian methods to turn things around. Just  crazytown
2023-08-16T10:06:01.000Z,"I have been a long term bear on China and have urged people to stay away from their stocks except for Baba which, at least, looks like an American stock. But if China were really falling apart our twenty year would be at 3.75% not 4.478%"
2023-08-16T08:55:27.000Z,"Here we are back in August of 2015 China... Same deal, China about to collapse, government urging calm, no panic, trusts offering too high a return and people watching savings wiped out.  All over again!"

2023-08-15T08:53:30.000Z,Market commentators talking about how China has knocked back our futures but how much of it might be that this indictment of Trump is the most likely to eliminate him as a candidate if it succeeds
2023-08-15T08:41:27.000Z,"Can't get the yield curve to ""uninvert"" without the ten year going higher in yield... It is also why i am more hawkish than most right now"

2023-08-15T08:38:50.000Z,The people who write these articles about China almost never compare them to the U.S. We used to think that we needed to China to grow fast for our industrials to prosper. That's no longer accurate. They have dramatically lessened their dependence on China. We have better growth

2023-08-14T16:31:59.000Z,"Let's be clear. I think that Nvidia should be owned and not traded. OWNED. I am tired of being hectored by people who say i hurt them in Nvidia. That is RIDICULOUS. Own it, don't trade it!"

2023-08-14T13:28:23.000Z,I am saying that the long knives are out for Solomon at GOldman and if he survives this period lets stop the speculation

2023-08-09T09:33:44.000Z,this deal is huge and I think the beginning of a revenue stream that can make Disney' stock be a bargain. My trust owns it and it has been a huge bust. But at this point i say you bet against Disney and send me an invitation to your funeral
2023-08-09T09:32:27.000Z,I liked this deal but no one seems to care. That's almost always a mistake
2023-08-09T09:00:01.000Z,We have to read endless articles about how perfectly healthy real estate investment trusts are going to default and meanwhile the Chinese have gigantic real estate assets with bonds trading at bankruptcy levels and you almost never hear about them!!!

2023-05-15T10:13:06.000Z,"I watched Vice when i started http://thestreet.com one year later. The key was keeping costs down and diversifying into sub revenue quickly, something the bankers disliked... but it worked. We were sold in a hostile takeover but we made starters money"
2023-05-15T10:10:51.000Z,We need solid evidence of a breakthrough between GOP and White House for a debt deal. Not rumors based on futures
2023-05-15T09:37:53.000Z,"Putin knows history; Germans give Ukraine planes, it's a kesselschlacht  against the conscripts and mass surrender.. U.S. does not know Great Patriotic War, Germans do..Not Stalingrad.. no Sixth Army, just a classic pocket...the dreaded Korsun"
2023-05-15T08:58:45.000Z,Will the twenty year de-invert? I think so
2023-05-15T08:57:26.000Z,Mike Wilson is dead right about the upcoming volatility; the GOP has no reason to make a deal this close to the election and not everyone cares about our ratings as much as our fiscal responsibility. I think our ratings are paramount and we must not be allowed to default
2023-05-15T00:33:41.000Z,It's been ages since we saw futures be higher before the next day's trading. It's a big reason why the market's been so discouraging. Yet I have a long piece out tonight for club members that might help....
2023-05-15T00:23:42.000Z,"i am working on what stocks could do well if we get to default status... I don't think anyone on Wall Street is taking this seriously enough We are two governments right now, not one"
2023-05-15T00:22:30.000Z,"It's difficult to get around what a default would look like. We know that each party seems to think that it could make the other look bad in a default.Historically it is the president who will be tagged with you not getting your Social Security check, Or have health care paid for"
